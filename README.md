    - [dual role key by Lydell](https://github.com/lydell/dual)
    - [Kbd Edit](http://www.kbdedit.com/demo.html)

 # Further development
 - try using [AHK](https://www.autohotkey.com/) to add extra features.
 - search for even faster layout creator with added benefit of 2 in 1 software to create 3rd level keyboard layout.
 - create 4th level keyboard for programming with [Ahk](https://www.autohotkey.com/) or some other utility softwares
