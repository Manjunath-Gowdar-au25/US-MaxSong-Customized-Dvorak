In this folder the software/script has already been modified to MaxSong keyboard layout,
you just have to goto us-maxsong-dvorak-customized and install which will install MaxSong keyboard layout (which was created by microsoft keyboard layout creator).

I have added touchCursors installation folder of my computer here, which did'nt work for direct installation,
therefore you have to install it and add the script manually as shown in the readme.md file.
